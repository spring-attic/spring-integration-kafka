/**
 * Annotation that marks a method to be the target of a Kafka message
 * listener within a class that is annotated with {@link KafkaListener}.
 *
 * <p>See the {@link KafkaListener} for information about permitted method signatures
 * and available parameters.
 * <p><b>It is important to understand that when a message arrives, the method selection
 * depends on the payload type. The type is matched with a single non-annotated parameter,
 * or one that is annotated with {@code @Payload}.
 * There must be no ambiguity - the system
 * must be able to select exactly one method based on the payload type.</b>
